# Factional — plan

This is the queue of increments for the reputation & factions module.

- Design: [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md)
- Decisions: [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md)
- Workflow: [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)

## Priorities

| Priority | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| **P0** | The core loop from the brief: alignment moved by actions, disposition, joining by similarity, relations, standing, rank, joining an enemy. |
| **P1** | Refinements already asked for: inertia, target-aware morality, drift, spillover, conflicts, modifiers, designer tooling. |
| **P2** | Wanted later: knowledge ripple, double agents, saves, visual tooling. |
| **P3** | After this module: embedding in a host engine. |

## Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Next** | The increment to pick up now. |
| **In progress** | Being built on a branch. |
| **Done** | Shipped; compressed to one line under Done. |
| **Blocked (O-n)** | Waiting on an open decision. |
| **Outline** | Detail and acceptance examples get written when the increment nears the front of the queue. |

## Order

The order below is the source of truth. Sections further down are grouped by phase for easy scanning, not in delivery order.

`F0 → F1 → F2 → A1 → A2 → A3 → D1 → D2 → M1 → M2 → M3 → M4 → M5 → M7 → A4 → A5 → D3 → M6 → M8 → M9 → M10 → T1 → T2 → T3 → T4 → K0 → K1 → K2 → K3 → K4 → E0 → E1 → Q0 → U0`

## Done

- F0 — workspace of four crates with lints and a pinned toolchain, CI with mutation testing on PRs, the `factional` CLI (`repl`, `run`), and the scenario harness; done 2026-10-04 (#1)
- F1 — `Fixed`, the two-decimal number every rule uses: exact parsing and display, arithmetic rounded half away from zero, checked overflow, TOML input; plus the `calc` CLI command; done 2026-10-04 (#2)
- F2 — `Curve`, the piecewise-linear shape of most tuning knobs: validation, evaluation rounded once, a bounds check, TOML input; plus the `curve <curve> at <x>` CLI command; done 2026-10-04 (#3)
- A1 — characters with a two-axis alignment and its nine-box label; loading `balance.toml` and `characters.toml` with every problem reported at once, by file and key path, with "did you mean" hints; Riverhold's sample characters; `load`, `characters`, `show character`; done 2026-10-04 (#4)
- A2 — the command-and-event core: `World::execute` (refused commands change nothing), numbered and time-stamped events, `World::replay`, the journal, `AdvanceTime`; `advance`, `time`, `events`, `journal`; done 2026-10-04 (#7)
- A3 — actions move alignment: `actions.toml` (alignment deltas), `PerformAction` with scale and witnesses, `ActionPerformed` and `AlignmentChanged`, clamping at the ends of each axis, refusals with "did you mean"; `actions`, `act`; done 2026-10-04 (#8)
- D1 — weights and distance: `factions.toml` (name, alignment, weights), character weights, `alignment.metric` and `alignment.default_weights`; an exact `distance(observer, subject)` query with its working; one id namespace for factions and characters, checked by `World::new` (P-32's mechanism, arriving early); `factions`, `show faction`, `distance [--explain]`; done 2026-10-05 (#9)
- D2 — disposition from affinity: `disposition.affinity` (a curve, checked within ±100 by `World::new`) and `disposition.bands` (validated: valid unique names, increasing `up_to`, only the last open-ended); a `disposition(observer, subject)` query with score, band and working; `disposition [--explain]`; plain "expected a number" errors; done 2026-10-05 (#10)
- M1 — factions' `tolerance` and `member_tolerance`, starting `memberships`; `JoinFaction` (refused with every failing check) and `LeaveFaction`; `assess_join` and membership queries; load warnings, starting with members outside member tolerance; `can-join [--explain]`, `join`, `leave`, memberships in `show`; done 2026-10-05 (#11)
- M2 — relations between factions: `relations.toml` (`between` and `from`/`to`), relation bands and `conflict_threshold`; `SetRelation` and `ShiftRelation` with `RelationChanged`; enemy exclusion in `assess_join`; invariant 6 kept by refusing a war between a character's own factions until M9; `relations`, `relate`; done 2026-10-05 (#12)
- M3 — standing: a store of how factions and characters regard each character; starting standing, action `standing` effects (target, target factions, named), `outcomes.toml`, `ApplyOutcome`, `ApplyEffects` and `StandingChanged`; the `awareness` seam (1.00); `leave_standing_change`; `standing`, `outcomes`, `outcome`; done 2026-10-05 (#13)
- M4 — the full disposition: affinity, standing, kinship (with `same_faction`), faction opinion and modifiers (0 until M10), each clamped to ±100, weighted by `disposition.weights` and summed; `disposition --explain` shows DESIGN.md §8.2's table, with where kinship and faction opinion came from; done 2026-10-05 (#14)
- M5 — rank ladders: `[[<faction>.ranks]]` with standing requirements and stricter tolerances, starting ranks, new members on the lowest rung; `Promote` (only on request, refused with every unmet requirement) and `Demote`, with `RankChanged`; `assess_promotion`; rank load checks and warnings; `ranks`, `promote [--explain]`, `demote`; done 2026-10-05 (#16)
- M7 — joining an enemy: `membership.defectors` and `membership.deserters` rule tables, and a faction's own, which may name its ranks; built in, defectors refuse everyone and deserters release everyone (D-4); load checks for conditions, outcomes, rungs, rank ids and a last rule that always decides; `assess_join` reports every rule tried in each table; defecting emits `LeftFaction(defected)` with the deserter cost, then `JoinedFaction` with the defector cost; `can-join --explain` shows each table; done 2026-10-05 (#18)

## Phase 1 — Characters and alignment

## Phase 2 — Perception

### D3 · Watched subjects and band-change events — P1 · Outline

**Covers:** DESIGN.md §8.3.

**Scope:** `Watch` and `Unwatch`, `DispositionBandChanged`, and `disposition.hysteresis`.

**Anchors:** to be written when D3 comes up next. They must cover:

- a band crossing, and the event it emits;
- no event when the score moves within a band;
- hysteresis holding a band near its edge.

**Validates** (DESIGN.md §12.2): `hysteresis` is ≥ 0.

## Phase 3 — Factions, standing and rank

### M6 · Standing spillover between factions — P1 · Outline

**Covers:** the spillover part of DESIGN.md §7.1: one hop, using the `standing.spillover` curve.

**Anchors**

- Robbing vex (guild −10.00) → `city_watch` +1.80.
- `donate_to_temple` (temple +10.00) → `city_watch` +1.00 and `ashen_circle` −2.40.
- `lantern_guild` ↔ `free_company` (+20) spills nothing under the default curve.

**Validates** (DESIGN.md §12.2): spillover multipliers are within −1…1.

### M8 · Drift policies and runtime faction alignment — P1 · Outline

**Covers:** DESIGN.md §9.3.

**Scope**

- The drift policies, probation with `grace_ticks`, rank tolerance overrides, and `expel_standing_change`.
- `SetFactionAlignment` and `ShiftFactionAlignment`, which emit `FactionAlignmentChanged` and trigger a membership review.

**Anchors:** to be written when M8 comes up next. They must cover:

- every policy;
- probation that clears, and probation that expires;
- a faction alignment change that pushes a member out.

**Validates** (DESIGN.md §12.2): drift policies are known; probation has `grace_ticks` > 0 and a `then`.

### M9 · When two of your factions go to war — P1 · Outline

**Covers:** DESIGN.md §9.4, D-16.

**Scope**

- A relation change that puts two of a character's factions in conflict emits `MembershipConflict` and marks both memberships as conflicted. This replaces M2's interim refusal (P-38).
- `ResolveConflict { character, keep }` ends the other membership with `LeftFaction { reason: ConflictResolved }`.
- `membership.conflict` sets the optional automatic rule, applied straight away or after `auto_after_ticks`. The rule keeps the higher rank, then the higher standing, then the longer service, then the lower faction id.
- Settle the standing consequences of leaving, and record the choice in DECISIONS.md.
- CLI: `resolve <character> <faction-to-keep>`.

**Anchors:** to be written when M9 comes up next. They must cover:

- a war declared between two of a character's factions;
- resolving it by hand;
- each tie-break of the automatic rule;
- `auto_after_ticks` running out, versus a resolution that arrives first.

**Validates** (DESIGN.md §12.2): `conflict.resolve` is `ask` or `auto`; `auto_after_ticks` is ≥ 0.

### M10 · Disposition modifiers from other modules — P1 · Outline

**Scope**

- `AddModifier { id, observer: everyone | faction | character, subject, amount, expires_at? }` and `RemoveModifier`.
- Modifiers expire on `AdvanceTime`.
- The modifiers component of disposition.

### A4 · Inertia profiles — P1 · Next

**Why:** D-6, where how easily an act moves someone depends on where they already stand. The same good deed moves a saint less than a neutral character (DESIGN.md §5.3, P-5).

**Scope**

- **Content.**
  - `balance.toml` gains `[inertia]`: `default_profile`, and `[inertia.profiles.<id>]`, each with up to four curves, `law.toward_lawful`, `law.toward_chaotic`, `good.toward_good` and `good.toward_evil`. Any curve a profile leaves out is 1.0.
  - A character may set `inertia = "<profile>"`; without it, the default profile applies.
  - Built in, with no `[inertia]`, the default is `steady`, whose every curve is 1.0: every act counts in full, as now.
- **The shift formula** (§5.2) multiplies each axis's shift by the curve for that axis and the direction of the shift, read at the character's position before the act. The product is computed exactly and rounded once (P-1): a curve value isn't rounded on its own first.
- **Outcomes and effects** move alignment with the character's inertia, as actions do.
- **CLI.** `act --explain` shows, per axis, the base delta, the scale, the inertia multiplier with its profile and curve, and the shift.

**Acceptance** (DESIGN.md §5.3, with the `hardening` profile from `docs/examples/riverhold`)

1. **A hardening character at good 60.00:**
   - helps a stranger (good +4.00): `toward_good` at 60 is 0.58, so +2.32, ending at 62.32;
   - extorts someone instead (good −6.00): `toward_evil` at 60 is 0.70, so −4.20, ending at 55.80.
2. **Rounded once.** `sister_mira`, hardening, at good 85.00 helps a stranger: `toward_good` at 85 is 0.405, so 4.00 × 0.405 = 1.62, ending at 86.62. (The outline had ×0.41 → +1.64, which rounds the multiplier first; P-1 rounds the product once.)
3. **A steady character** gets the full shift: +4.00.
4. **A curve left out** is 1.0: a hardening character's law moves in full.
5. **Load errors at their keys:**
   - a character's `inertia`, or `default_profile`, naming a profile that doesn't exist, with a "did you mean";
   - a curve name other than the four, such as `good.toward_lawful`;
   - a multiplier below 0 anywhere on a curve.

**Validates** (DESIGN.md §12.2): a character's `inertia`, and `inertia.default_profile`, name a profile that exists; profiles use only `law`/`good` × `toward_*` curves; multipliers are ≥ 0.

### A5 · Target-aware action effects — P1 · Outline

**Covers:** DESIGN.md §5.4; D-18, P-28.

**Scope**

- Optional `by_target.<axis>` and `by_target.relation` curves on actions, with every multiplier validated ≥ 0.
- The target multiplier joins the shift formula (§5.2), which still rounds once.
- `act --explain` shows each multiplier and where it came from.

**Anchors** (`murder`, as in DESIGN.md §13)

- The player murders brother_ash: good × 0.44 → −6.60; law −10.00, unscaled.
- The player murders sister_mira: good × 1.43 → −21.45.
- captain_hale murders vex: good −6.64 (target 0.84, relation 0.62, inertia 0.85); law −6.20 (relation 0.62).
- An action without `by_target` curves, or performed without a target, shifts exactly as before.

**Validates** (DESIGN.md §12.2): `by_target` multipliers are ≥ 0, and `by_target` names only an axis or `relation`.

## Phase 4 — Designer tooling and persistence

### T1 · Validation sweep and JSON Schema — P1 · Outline

- `factional validate <dir>` reports every error and warning at once, without loading a world. Each increment adds its own checks as it lands (DESIGN.md §12.2); T1 adds the warnings that need the whole world: a faction no starting character could join, and a rank no one can reach.
- `factional schema` produces the JSON Schema for editor autocomplete.
- A content README for designers.

### T2 · What-if: compare and reload — P1 · Outline

- `factional compare <scenario> --content A --against B` shows:
  - a diff of the final state: alignments, standings, memberships, ranks, and dispositions toward watched subjects;
  - the first event where the two runs diverge.
- In the REPL, `reload` re-reads the content, replays the journal, and reports what changed.

### T3 · Map, matrix and curves — P2 · Outline

- `map <faction>` draws the alignment plane as ASCII, showing the faction's tolerance region and the characters.
- `matrix [--csv]` shows every observer's disposition toward the chosen subjects.
- `curve <knob>` prints a named knob's curve as a table, extending F2's `curve <curve> at <x>`; `curve <knob> at <x>` evaluates it.

### T4 · Saves — P2 · Outline

- Serialises a snapshot plus the event log, with a format version.
- Loading gives identical query answers; a property test checks it.
- Format details are settled here (X-3).

## Phase 5 — Knowledge and rumour

### K0 · Design pass: witnesses, ripple, perceived alignment — P2

A design section and its decisions, agreed before K1 starts. It settles X-1, and designs the double agents that D-19 asks for.

### K1 · Witnessed acts — P2 · Outline

**Validates** (DESIGN.md §12.2): `knowledge.model` is a known model.

### K2 · Ripple through the social graph — P2 · Outline

### K3 · Perceived alignment — P2 · Outline

Depends on K0's answer.

### K4 · Secret membership and double agents — P2 · Outline

An opt-in option to belong to a faction without its enemies knowing. Designed in K0 (D-19).

## Phase 6 — Embedding

### E0 · Choose a host engine and integration route — P3

Settles X-2.

### E1 · Host adapter — P3

## Beyond this module

### Q0 · Quest module design pass: reconciling questlines across factions — P3

The quest module comes after this one. Its first step is a design pass that settles X-4: what it means for a faction's quests and questlines to reconcile with every other faction they affect, and those factions' questlines, at every stage, and how the loader checks it (D-20, DESIGN.md §16). No quest content loads until that check exists.

### U0 · Editor design pass: web or egui — P3

Settles X-5. Comes after T1, whose JSON Schema can drive the forms, and after Q0, which defines the quest model a questline editor would edit. Likely prerequisites: a format-preserving TOML writer in `factional-content` (`toml_edit`), `Serialize` on query results and their breakdowns, and an editor facade crate beside `cli` that nothing depends on.

## Adding an increment

Use the same shape as above:

1. The id, title, priority and status.
2. **Why.**
3. **Scope.**
4. **Acceptance** examples. Work their numbers out by hand from DESIGN.md's formulas; never take them from the code's output.
5. The CLI commands it ships.
6. Any knobs it adds. These go in DESIGN.md §12 too.
